# Full Stack Developer Coding Exercise
A coding exercise to assess the competency of candidates.

## About us
Zappyrent‚Äôs mission is to make renting a fast and affordable experience for tenants and safe for landlords. On Zappyrent, landlords find a tenant for their home  and receive monthly payments, even if the tenant stops paying. Tenants get an agent-like experience at no cost.

## Context
The goal of the assessment is getting to know the candidate as well as possible. We think the best way to achieve this goal is to let candidates express themselves in the way she or he knows best: programming.

There are several languages, libraries or frameworks, and we cannot expect you to know everything, of course... also in the real world, you will always face something new.

For those reasons, we believe technologies shouldn't be an issue for a good developer, and this means that during the exercise you will use the technologies we are using at Zappyrent. Therefore, we are going to ask you to perform a task for us. You don't need to master anything but good development practices.

It won't be easy, but this is an opportunity to show us what you can do outside your comfort zone. Developers often say that they don't have opportunities to try new things, so this moment could be one of them.

Thank you very much and happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíª


## Coding exercise #1: broad range
With this exercise you will touch all the layers in a basic 3-layer web application. The requirements are very simple, and you should not do anything other than what you are asked for.  

You should develop a simple CRUD web application (WA), like a todo list, for example. The WA should provide the basic functionalities for listing, creating, showing and deleting items of your choice (task, todo, blog, post, ...).  

You should develop both backend and frontend.  
Data have to be persisted in a database.  
Authentication is not required.  
The application should provide a README explaining how we can run the application locally or whatever you think is relevant to us.  
Bonus point: The application should be containerized with docker and docker-compose.

### Backend
[nestjs](https://nestjs.com/)

### Database
Postgres or mysql

### Frontend
[React-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)

## Coding exercise #2: frontend

Go to [Zappyrent](https://www.zappyrent.com/en). In the section "Our cities," you will see a showcase with all our cities:

The candidate should develop the component item in the showcase:   

![component_tem!](component_tem.png)     

Bonus point: develop a mobile version of the component. 

## Coding exercise #3: backend
You should extend the backend you developed in coding exercise #1, adding rate limit API calls functionality.
